        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          As the perduring pandemic has left many of us feeling more isolated
          and disconnected than ever, we feel that we need better ways to
          intimately connect with our loved ones without being capitalized upon
          and politically manipulated. Therefore with Greenhouse Hub, we want to
          explore the theme of digital interactions and connectivity in a
          different way from commonplace social media. By breaking away from the
          matrix of domination created by big technology companies which dictate
          how online socializing looks like, we want to reflect on what makes a
          digital space inclusive and on how we could go around designing a
          caring online community and environment. As such, we want to reflect
          on what it means to create a space collaboratively with the users, a
          space that would be both safe and nurturing for them and which would
          allow them to be comfortable with being co-creators of this space.
          Moreover, we also wanted to remove ourselves from the world of
          intrusive, attention-grabbing notifications, advertisements and
          otherworldly interruptions and distractions. Therefore, working in an
          explorable networked space is the basic requirement to create an
          environment for the cultivation of this kind of connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Greenhouse Hub, the user cultivates precious plants, not in their
          own but in someone else’s garden. It can be a friend’s, a lover’s, or
          even a stranger’s. First they choose a seed to gift. There are three
          types of seeds that can be chosen from and each will bloom into a
          different plant. Then, by providing dutiful and thoughtful care
          through sweet notes, photos, videos, memes, gifs, and other creative
          media, the gardens will bloom beautifully and more plants can be
          grown. Other options like watering the plant, removing pests, and
          pollination could also potentially be included to improve the
          gardening experience. The actions are not designed to be competitive
          but rather collaborative. The main goal is to connect with each other
          despite being physically away from each other, share cute moments and
          show that they think about each other in a peaceful and non-intrusive
          environment. We want users to feel comfortable and cozy and allow them
          to completely focus on each other. And of course, we want to foster
          meaningful and happy relationships over a shared goal of nurturing a
          plant.
        </p>
        <p>
          We imagine this world as an infinite explorable three-dimensional
          space where every user has their own tiny greenhouses called pods
          hanging magically like a constellation of tiny individual bubbles. The
          users can navigate through this space (maybe while playing their
          favorite playlist) and visit each other. Every pod can be visited by
          the other users although they need to pair up to be able to start
          growing plants. We want to give users the ability to choose what they
          want to do in this world, that is, they will need to intentionally
          want to connect with Greenhouse Hub and their loved ones. There will
          be no notifications to alert them to come to check it even when they
          receive new messages. It is only through continuous collaboration and
          communication that the garden will be healthy and bloom. Plants will
          have various stages of growth from seed to seedling to young bud to
          mature blossom. Implicitly, we hope that Greenhouse Hub will also
          reinforce the user’s connection to nature and hopefully even inspire
          an interest in gardening through the simulation of cultivating a
          plant. We also want to empower users to feel good about themselves
          when they view their progress and in some way give a visual
          representation of their mutual efforts to develop a relationship with
          someone else. By providing the option to be able to connect with
          strangers, we want to promote positive psychology and bring some
          happiness to others.

            Lovebox for Lovers is a connected messaging device that allows users
            to send messages to each other through an app and receive them via
            the device which looks like a cute box with a lid. A heart-shaped
            spinner spins in the stead of a sound notification and upon opening
            the lid, the box reveals an LCD screen displaying the message. The
            goal of this device is to help friends and lovers connect from a
            distance through instant expressions of affection like pictures,
            colourful messages, stickers and drawings. The app also allows the
            storage of numerous accumulated love notes. Users can also
            communicate by physically manipulating the box as the rotation of
            the heart-shaped spinner will result in a waterfall of hearts on the
            app of the destined loved one. Originally, Lovebox was born in 2015
            from the affection and thoughtful attention of Jean who was doing
            research on robotics at MIT while his fiancee stayed in France. “He
            wanted to find a way to send not only messages, but his love
            regardless of the distance” and this led him to the building of the
            very first prototype. Later on, Lovebox was launched as a startup
            with the mission of leveraging technology to help people feel and
            express love and counter the attention-grabbing efforts deployed by
            “Big Tech” (“Lovebox”).

            Habitica is a free app focused on helping users build habits and
            increase productivity in a game setting. The inspiration behind the
            game was born from this question: if people could invest so much
            time leveling up their characters in games, why can’t they spend the
            same amount of time developing their real lives? The app uses a
            social network as a form of motivation by encouraging friends to
            compete with each other to see who meets more of their self-defined
            goals. Users can create a party with their friends and track each
            other’s progress. The game contains spaces for meeting strangers as
            well, such as taverns, where the user can “rest”, take a break from
            their daily habits without suffering any health consequences, and
            chat with other users. They can also join guilds, such as an artist
            guild, that assigns special tasks and allows users to connect over a
            similar passion. When the tasks are completed, the user accumulates
            points that go towards rewards and achievements. These rewards can
            take the form of a break (the activity is chosen by the user), or
            achievements that upgrade the user’s avatar. This reward system
            enhances the experience of completing the task, making the challenge
            of adopting healthier habits more gratifying (“Habitica”).

            New Nature by artist Marpi is a digital petting zoo presented at an
            art exhibition at Artechouse between October 13th, 2018 and January
            6th, 2019. It is the first large-scale solo exhibition of Marpi and
            also the first artwork displayed at Artechouse based on real-time
            generated graphics and machine learning. The artwork showcases an
            immersive digital terrarium filled with nature-inspired creatures
            and plants which can react and adapt to the visitor’s presence and
            movements. Thus as viewers engage with the creatures, the artwork
            responds with real-time computer-generated movements to simulate an
            organic creature being pet. Moreover, landscapes and creatures
            evolve, morph and melt as they are engaged with. As they walk
            through the different installations at this exhibition, different
            types of movements from the viewers result in different reactions
            from the digital creatures. In the main gallery, visitors are
            represented as human-shaped organisms which can interact with a 24ft
            creature. Their movements forwards, backwards and upwards by jumping
            translate into their digital representations moving in front and
            behind the said creature while an app was also created to allow them
            to feed and play with it. In Gallery One, we see an environment
            where digital trees awake in response to visitors stepping into the
            space. The trees then light up and display a colourful show to the
            viewers. In Gallery Two, gears inspired by succulents respond to the
            visitors’ movements by twisting and turning on the walls and floor.
            In the Media Lab, five pods containing several creatures learn and
            grow using AI and the visitors can use the digital hand to explore
            the environment and interact with creatures inside it (Marpi).

          <h3>Comparing Similar Projects with Greenhouse Hub</h3>
          <p>
            Greenhouse Hub echoes the goals of Lovebox as they are both designed
            to foster relationships of love and companionship through sending
            caring messages between people. However, while Greenhouse Hub’s
            actions were imagined to only take place in the digital realm,
            Lovebox’s method of sending messages is dependent on a physical box,
            one that is quite expensive as well. We aspire to facilitate
            friendly exchanges in an accessible and affordable way. This entails
            that it is free to join and simple to navigate. Lovebox uses a heart
            indicator to notify the receiver that a message has arrived. Our
            project will not pressure the users to return to the world by
            concealing all visual notifications outside the website. In
            Habitica, a community of friends and strangers alike gather in a
            virtual space to garner motivation to get tasks done. Progressing in
            the game and unlocking achievements equate to higher levels of
            productivity. Conversely, in Greenhouse Hub, all the productivity is
            focused on forming a stronger connection with your podmate and
            fellow navigators of the world. Furthermore, unlike Habitica’s very
            structured user interface, our project aims to be much more
            immersive, visually and sonically. Rather than be constrained to the
            usual buttons for navigation, we will promote exploration by
            enabling people to travel in a 3D area. Finally, New World by Marpi
            exemplifies the liveliness we want to infuse in the plants. Although
            we won’t go as far as to program them to respond to user movement
            using A.I., we will make them flourish with the care given to them
            through user actions. The motion of “growing” a relationship is
            therefore demonstrated through the visual appearance of the plant.
